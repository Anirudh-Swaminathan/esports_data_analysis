### Folder Organization ###
 - images : contains images generated, or used by our code. Also contains a mp4 file generated by clustering visualization
 - notebooks : contains all Jupyter Notebooks + the Final_notebook.ipynb which mirrors all the visualizations provided in the presentation
 - scratch : contains python source codes that we used to figure the dataset out and experiment on
 - src : the final python source files that are used for generating visualizations for the presentation


### Usage ###
All the data we used can be found in the following link:https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19

We stored our dataset outside the GitHub repository to avoid pushing large objects frequently.
Feel free to download the data.csv file and change the directory to access it appropriately.


### Visualizations ###
All the code and clustering can be found in the notebooks file, and the images we generated are stored in the images file.

### Clustering ###
What does clustering mean/how do we do it
